 ## Task-1 IRIS Dataset
 The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.It includes three iris species 
 with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.The columns in this dataset are:
Id
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm
Species

## Task-2 Unemployment Anaylsis

The objective of this analysis is to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the job market in India. We will use a dataset containing the unemployment rate of all the states in India. The dataset includes information such as States, Date, Frequency, Estimated Unemployment Rate (%), Estimated Employed, and Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%).

This dataset contains the unemployment rate of all the states in India
States = states in India Date = date which the unemployment rate observed Frequency = measuring frequency (Monthly) Estimated Unemployment Rate (%) = percentage of people unemployed in each States of India Estimated Employed = Number of people employed Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%) = The labour force participation rate is the portion of the working population in the 16-64 years' age group in the economy currently in employment or seeking employment.

## Task-3 Car-Price Prediction
Car price prediction is a significant area of research in machine learning, aiming to forecast the price of a car based on various factors such as brand goodwill, car features, Selling_Price, Driven_kms, and more. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately predict car prices using relevant features.

## Task- 4 E-mail spam-classifier
One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

## Task-5 Sales Prediction with Advertisement dataset
The advertising dataset captures sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement spends across multiple channles like radio, tv and newspaper.which provides detailed insights into how advertising spending across different media channels influences sales outcomes. This dataset covers comprehensive advertising campaigns data and their corresponding sales, allowing us to analyze the effectiveness of media spend in generating sales revenue.
